  "description": "You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality\u2019s forge.\nSome transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.",

        "description": "Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object com posed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance."

When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter\u2019s stone is destroyed and can\u2019t be remade until you finish a long rest.\nMajor Transformation: You can transmute one nonmagical object\u2014no larger than a 5-foot cube\u2014into another nonmagical object of similar size and m ass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.\n Panacea: You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter\u2019s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.\n Restore Life: You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter\u2019s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.\nRestore Youth: You touch the transmuter\u2019s stone to a willing creature, and that creature\u2019s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn\u2019t extend the creature\u2019s lifespan."
