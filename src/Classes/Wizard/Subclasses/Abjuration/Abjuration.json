  "description": "The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.\nCalled abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism , when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.",

      "title": "Arcane Ward", 
      "description": "Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. W hen you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell\u2019s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.\nWhile the ward has 0 hit points, it can\u2019t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.\nOnce you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest."
