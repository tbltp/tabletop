  "description": "The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves\u2019 guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside\u2014at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins\u2014 sometimes called avengers or dark knights\u2014their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.\nTenets of Vengeance: The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.\nFight the Greater Evil: Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil.\nNo Mercy for the Wicked: Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.\nBy Any Means Necessary: My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.\nRestitution: If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.",
