Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods\u2019 tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels\u2014the perfect servants of good\u2014as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\nTenets of Devotion: Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\nHonesty: Dont lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\nCourage: Never fear to act, though caution is wise.\nCompassion: Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.\nHonor: Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.\nDuty: Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care. and obey those who have just authority over you.",
